<div class="about">
    <p>We specialize in breeding French Bulldog puppies and focus on quality and health as our priority. As a family breeder, we meet the strict genetic testing and breeding criteria. Quirky, playful, and full of energy, the French Bulldog is the epitome of a small dog with a big personality. Suitable for families with or without children, French Bulldogs can quickly feel like part of the family. With careful introductions and with the right socialization, French Bulldogs can get along with other dogs and even cats.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As a teenager that I discovered a passion for raising puppies. I picked a French Bulldog for my first dog because I liked their personality, confirmation traits such as the flat muzzle and bulldog looks. It was and still is a great joy to watch them grow. I especially enjoy the first days their eyes begin to open and they begin to steady themselves and finally walk. We also really enjoy socializing and playing with them. Spending every day with puppies is amazing therapy for today's hustle and bustle. </p>
    <br>
    <p>At the forefront of our minds is always the health and wellbeing of our pets. We have environmental controlled housing with temperature adjustment capabilities and air quality filtration. We also have outdoor play areas dedicated to each individual and we socialize with them daily. Our vet makes weekly visits to do health checks so we can be confident each of our pets is at peak health. We routinely visit breeder seminars to take advantage of the latest research and stay up to date on health and wellness standards. It is ultimately our goal though to exceed the standards for raising puppies and seek to raise the happiest healthiest pups that we can. Our pets are fed only top quality grain free dog food, supplements, and immune boosters. </p>
